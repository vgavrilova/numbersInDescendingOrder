# numbersInDescendingOrder

Hello everyone!

This is an application which prints out the numbers you entered in descending order. The whole functionality is happening in the class 
<i>SortedArray.</i><br><br>
Firstly, the program asks you to enter n integer numbers (where n = the parameter entered while creating an object) in the console.
This parameter is then forwarded to the method <i>getIntegers(int[] toInsert).</i> This function returns an integer array and passes it 
to the method <i>sortIntegers(int[] insertedArr).</i><br><br>
The array is sorted using Bubble algorithm and the value is forwarded to the last method - <i>printIntegers(int[] sortedInt).</i>
This is the only method that can be used in the Main class. It gives a user an already sorted array in descending order.<br>
For further explanation and functionality see the comments in my code.<br><br>


If you have any remarks and/or suggestions to my code, please let me know.

Have fun!
